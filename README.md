# About the tool

Hello, my friend! I hope you are doing good (=

A few words about the tool - currently this is an experimental application to provide just another client for awesome ZESP service (there is ZESP
developers [telegram channel](https://t.me/zesp32)).

# How to use

Built and ready to use application is available on [zesp.dipteam.com](http://zesp.dipteam.com/) (for the moment ZESP service doesn't allow you to use `https` scheme, so be sure you
are with `http`).

## Can I start it locally on my PC or my hub devices?

Definitely yes.

- Just download the already built application from [gh-page branch](https://github.com/NickRimmer/zesp-ui/tree/gh-pages) and open `index.html`
- If you want to play with source codes, to build it as a regular React application execute `npm run build` or `npm start` to start it locally for development.
